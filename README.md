# Crypto-currencies

The Crypto-currencies is a microservice, which is using <a href="https://grpc.io/" target="_blank">gRPC technology</a>.
The service provides the latest data about all cryptocurrencies on the market.
It supports both unary and bidirectional streaming calls, which allows data update every 15 seconds.
When an error occurs, it handles it in a non-fatal way with the error message.

The whole service is containerized using a Docker engine and everything can be easily run and deployed with the pre-prepared `make` commands in the Makefile.

The Cryptocurrencies obtains all necessary data from the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all" target="_blank">CoinMarketCap</a> website. The algorithm does not infringe any copyrights nor the website robots exclusion protocol.

## Installation

### Requirements
- <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">Git</a>
- <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" target="_blank">Docker Engine</a>

### Linux/Mac
This is the exact way to download and run the service. On a Windows machine, the installation process would be slightly different.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/chutified/crypto-currencies.git     # download repository
$ cd crypto-currencies        # move to repository dir
$ make build                  # build docker image
$ make run                    # initialize service
```

## Supported crypto currencies
The service supports a large number of cryptocurrencies, so they are listed <a href="https://github.com/chutified/crypto-currencies/blob/master/docs/currencies.md" taget="_blan">here</a>.

**Note:**
*The Crypto request holds the key "Name" and its value is **not** case sensitive.*
*So the Crypto names must not be completely lowercase nor uppercase to be found.*

## Documentation
### Crypto.GetCrypto
GetCrypto responses with the data about the cryptocurrency.  Name, symbol, market cap in USD, current price, circulating supply, mineable info, currency changes in last hour/day/week in percentages data are provided.

**GetCryptoRequest** defines the request message for the cryptocurrency request. It requires the fullname or the symbol of supported cryptocurrency. The list of the supported cryptocurrecies can be found <a href="https://github.com/chutified/crypto-currencies/blob/master/docs/currencies.md">here</a>

*Name stands for the fullname or the symbol of the requested crypto currency.The Name is not case sensitive.*
```proto
message GetCryptoRequest {
    string Name = 1;
}
```
```json
{
    "Name":"Bitcoin"
}
```

**GetCryptoResponse** defines the response message for the the GetCrypto and indirectly for the SubscribeCrypto rpc calls. The response holds the cryptocurreny's fullname, symbol, market capitalization in USD, current price in USD, circulating supply, whether is it mineable, volume and changes in the last hour/day/week.

*Name is the full name of the cryptocurrency. The Name value is fully capitalized.*<br>
*Symbol is the short version of the full currency name. The Symbol value is fully capitalized.*<br>
*MarketCapUSD is the currency's total value in the market.*<br>
*Price is the current cryptocurrency value in USD.*<br>
*CirculatingSupply is the amount of the cryptocurrency which is publicly available and is circulating in the market.*<br>
*Mineable is a bool value which indicates, whether is the currency mineable or not.*<br>
*Volume is the total value of the currencies in USD which was traded in the last 24 hours.*<br>
*Change is the percentage value which indicates the changes of the currency value in last hour, day or week.*
```proto
message GetCryptoResponse {
    string Name = 1;
    string Symbol = 2;
    double MarketCapUSD = 3;
    double Price = 4;
    double CirculatingSupply = 5;
    bool Mineable = 6;
    double Volume = 7;
    string ChangeHour = 8;
    string ChangeDay = 9;
    string ChangeWeek = 10;
}
```
```json
{
    "Name": "BITCOIN",
    "Symbol": "BTC",
    "MarketCapUSD": 2.14545628107e+11,
    "Price": 11629.57,
    "CirculatingSupply": 1.8448287e+07,
    "Volume": 2.6411600115e+10,
    "ChangeHour": "0.30%",
    "ChangeDay": "4.48%",
    "ChangeWeek": "21.41%"
}
```

### Crypto.SubscribeCrypto
SubscribeCrypto subscribes the client for the requested currency. Everytime new data are fetched from the source all clients receive the new GetCrypto responses for each subscribed currency.

**GetCryptoRequest:** <a href="https://github.com/chutified/crypto-currencies#cryptogetcrypto">already documented</a>
(<a href="https://github.com/chutified/crypto-currencies/blob/master/docs/currencies.md">supported values</a>)

*Name stands for the fullname or the symbol of the requested crypto currency.The Name is not case sensitive.*
```json
{"Name":"Bitcoin"}
{"Name":"ETH"}
```

**SubscribeCryptoResponse** defines the response message for the SubscribeCrypto rpc call.  The message is composed either of the GetCryptoResponse if no error occurs during the request handle or the grpc.Status which holds the grpc status code and the error message.

*GetCryptoResponse is the response message with the data of the subscribed currency.*<br>
*Error is the error message of the failed request handle.*
```proto
message SubscribeCryptoResponse {
    oneof message {
        GetCryptoResponse GetCryptoResponse = 1;
        google.rpc.Status Error = 2;
    }
}
```
```json
{
    "GetCryptoResponse": {
        "Name": "BITCOIN",
        "Symbol": "BTC",
        "MarketCapUSD": 2.14717599127e+11,
        "Price": 11638.89,
        "CirculatingSupply": 1.8448293e+07,

        "ChangeHour": "0.20%",
        "ChangeDay": "4.56%",
        "ChangeWeek": "21.50%"
    }
}

    "GetCryptoResponse": {
        "Name": "ETHEREUM",
        "Symbol": "ETH",
        "MarketCapUSD": 3.9797045174e+10,
        "Price": 355.34,
        "CirculatingSupply": 1.11996689e+08,
        "Volume": 1.3185626922e+10,
        "ChangeHour": "0.17%",
